Download temperature data
1. Calculate the mean temperature for each grid box during 1990-2016. 

2. Plot the multi-year mean (Step 1) on a map. Use the function plote.field.

3. Find the gridbox where Site 1 is located. Then extract the monthly mean temperature of that gridbox.

4. Calculate the ozone anomaly in Site 1, which can be obtained by removing the long-term linear trends.
Letâ€™s say y is ozone concentrations
x=1:length(y)
fit<-lm(y~x)
y$residual is the anomaly

5. Calculate the correlation of temperature (from Step 3) and ozone anomaly (from Step 4).

6. Repeat Step 3-5 over all sites.
