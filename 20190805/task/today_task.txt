(1) For site 1, calculate the correlations of detrended seasonal mean ozone with temperature in all grid boxes. Plot the correlations and see what you can find. 

(2) Check the correlations with other meteorological variables including relative humidity, u-wind and v-wind.

(3) Letâ€™s say the correlation pattern in Step 1 is A, find a way to quantify the magnitude of this pattern in each year. For example, the temperature field in 2008 is B, the covariance cov(A,B) should help do the job. But you may have other better ways.

(4) From Step 3, you have found a way to make use of the spatial information. Then use it to help improve the R2 of your linear model.
