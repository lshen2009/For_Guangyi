Plot

(1) Calculate the linear trends of summertime mean ozone concentrations for each site.
(2) Plot the linear trends on a map.

Plays with the data
(3) For each year, calculate the number of sites that have observations. Learn how to use the apply function.
(4) For each site, calculate the fraction of missing data.

Store the data
(5) Store the data into a 3D matrix (year x month x site). More specifically, the dimension of the matrix is (2016-1990+1)x3x52. Then save this matrix into a R object.
